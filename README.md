# Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
With a huge swath of employees, an interesting alternative to retirement comes up: mentorship. We want to find who is soon eligible for retirement, and who could be mentored.

## Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
* A lot of engineers. A lot retiring, a lot eligible for mentorship.
* Management in particular has a great opportunity to pick a few key leaders in the younger groups to manage. Small but mighty team likely with a lot of insight into macro approaches. 
* The provided tables could use a thorough cleaning before doing more analysis
* A more narrow search of roles is probably an important next step, as the cleaned data is still such a wide swath. Narrowing into a couple more key indicators to get a manageable sample group would likely be a better scope for the mentorship program
## Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

Approximately 50,000 based on this data. Based on expected growth for Hewlett-Packard according to [this article](https://www.barrons.com/articles/hp-enterprise-lays-out-multi-year-growth-plan-51602806338), another 6,000 hires should likely added for projected growth.

### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

Perhaps. It depends on the scope of mentorship and the ratio to mentor vs mentee. A skilled and proven Senior Engineer could very easily mentor 3 to 5 newcomers to the fold. A potential problem for this kind of continued investment approach is hiring the right younger engineers. The current job climate incentivizes hopping between jobs every 2 to 3 years for young professionals. The hiring team should be focused on engineers that value stability and use the mentorship program to build extra buy-in for the employees to stay committed to the company.
